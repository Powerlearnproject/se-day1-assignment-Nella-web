Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.**

**Software engineering in technology industry is important in creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g communication, finance, healthcare etc.**


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**1. Programming languages e.g Fortran, C**
**2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline around 1960s**
**3. Advent of structured programming around 1970s**
**4. Rise of agile methodologies around 2000s**


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**1. Requirement analysis;- gathering and documenting user needs and customer requirements.**
**2. Design;- high-level detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.**
**3. Implementation;- writing code and building software as per design specifications.**
**4. Testing;- conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.**
**5. Deployment;- releasing software to users and customers.**
**6. Maintenance;- ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.**


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Waterfall methodology involves sequential approach i.e requirement analysis, design and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall, whereas agile methodology involves iterative and incremental approach which is mainly about flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.**


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software developer;- writes code and implements software solutions.***
**Quality Assurance Engineer;- ensures software quality, designs and executes test plans.**
**Project manager;- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software products.**

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples are visual studio, eclipse, intelliJ IDEA.**

**Version Control Systems (VCS) help in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples are Git, Subversion.**


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

**Some common challenges are;-**
**1. Changing requirements during development cycle which may lead to project delays and scope creep.*
**2. Tight deadlines which may result in pressure leading to rushed development and compromised quality.*
**3. Technical debt as a result of short cuts and suboptimal solutions which may impede future development efforts and increased maintenace costs.*

**Strategies for overcoming these challenges are;-**
**1. Effective communication*
**2. Prioritization of tasks*
**3. Agile methodologies*
**4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.*


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Unit testing is testing individual components of software**
**Integration testing is testing different components or subsystems**
**System testing is testing the entire software as a whole**
**Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements**

*The testing ensures the software meets user needs.**



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements in order to get best possible responses from AI models.**
**It helps to get best responses from AI assistant or robot.**


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**"Give recipe of cooking an egg"**

**"Give a step-by-step recipe of making a spanish omelette"**

**The improved prompt is more effective because it is more concise and clearly outlines on the specific method of cooking the egg.*
